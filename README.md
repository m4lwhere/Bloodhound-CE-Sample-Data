# Bloohound-CE-Sample-Data
Sample data to load into Bloodhound Community Edition. Based on GOADv2.

This data is used to help others who want to learn how to use BloodHound Community Edition through sample data. I've noticed that there doesn't seem to be much available sample data to learn how to use BHCE, while there's plenty of sample data for Legacy BloodHound. This repo aims to solve that problem.

This data was gathered on April 10th, 2024 using SharpHound.exe v2.3.3 and the BloodHound.py (bloodhound-ce branch) which can be ingested into BloodHound v5.8.0.
